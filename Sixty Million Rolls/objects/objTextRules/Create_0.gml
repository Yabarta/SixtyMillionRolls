You have 10 dices and your objective is to make them land on 6 all at once. Chances are actually 1 in 60.000.000. So you better buy some upgrades.
Use the mouse to navigate and press space to roll the dices.

SHOP SYSTEM

Every time you get a 6 you will be rewarded with a honeycomb. Once you get enough honeycombs you can buy one of the following:

1.Honey:   make a dice gooey so it always stays on 6 (Maximum of 3).
2.Flower:  make the production better by eliminating all ones (twos and threes by upgrade).
3.Bee:     sting a dice to make it roll again (Maximum of 3).";
